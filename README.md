# React useEffect Hook with Incorrect Conditional Rendering
This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and conditional rendering.  The provided code snippet showcases incorrect usage of conditional logic within the `useEffect` hook, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle conditional logic within the `useEffect` hook for accurate and efficient updates.

## Problem
The initial code has an `useEffect` hook that only logs a message when the `count` is greater than 0.  This does not affect the rendering of the component or the functionality of the increment button.  This behavior is likely unintended and demonstrates a common pitfall in how developers integrate conditional rendering with state updates within the `useEffect` hook.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the more appropriate and flexible usage of the `useEffect` hook, ensuring the component updates according to intended behavior. This involves ensuring the conditional logic is appropriately linked to state updates and any necessary component re-rendering.
